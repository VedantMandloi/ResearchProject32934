Your never gonna stop missing her/him but all you have to do is just tell yourself you had this person for this long and its time for them to leave think of it as a dollar coaster if you stayed on the same rollercoaster itd get boring so you have to change.

Is there any way you can seperate them? maybe youre feeling confused, sad, angry... etc. I know this is a bit silly to say, but I am sure your mom is trying her best to understand you. It is hard for someone to know exactly what you are thikning, so maybe with some help, you can explain to her exactly what you are feeling and how she might be able to help you. I know for me, I thought my mum just didnt understand me. She didnt know what i was talking about, and she certainly didnt understand what i was going through. With some help from a counsellor, I was able to sort of understand things through what she might be seeing about me, without me telling her what i felt. WE then worked together so that i could approach her and tell her what she was doing that was making me feel uncomfortable and then we spoke about what i wanted her to be doing for me, as in her responses and the way she spoke to me.

I have leant him substantial amounts of money and not received it back. I'm a student - I'm trying to deal with my own mental health issues + his at the same time while trying to build a life for myself. I've often written posts on here about him before. It seems like he is an awful person from what I've just said, but he is very smart, caring, funny and loving. However his behaviour is now affecting me and everyone around him. He refuses to accept that he is causing any problems. I've spent my inheritance money trying to help him, but theres been no change and no support from his family. He goes to uni now which is great, but he is still so irresponsible - and it is almost like he is my son - which is disturbing. I try to avoid having sex, I hate it to be perfectly honest. If I move back home with my parents he won't be able to pay rent. His parents wont take him back. I can't leave him because he doesn't have the capacity to care for himself. I feel like I need to be selfish and move back home, but at the same time I need to look after him otherwise theres a good chance he might try to hurt himself. I'm tired of having to pay for him and be responsible for his things. Any advice?</td>\n",

Basically, it all started when my friend called me fat one day and I looked in the mirror and thought ''she's right\". I was 75kg at the time, which was slightly above the recommended for my height (I'm 5'8'') I decided to change my life, I went on a diet and joined a gym, I seriously cared about the processed foods I was putting in my body before and how much they had damaged me. Anyways, I ended up dropping down to 55kg at my lowest, I was feeling myself! Like I thought I looked so hot, I still got fussy about things not looking nice on me sometimes but overall I was happy with myself and my life. Then my parents started to get worried because the weight was just not staying on at all, I kept losing kgs without trying. My period stopped, and my Mum says white hair stared growing on my arms but I honestly didn't even notice. Then I started my senior years of schooling. With the HSC on the horizon, in Year 11 I put so much pressure on myself to study and do well, that in my spare time I would binge eat. When I started feeling sad about that, I wouldn't eat for the entire day the next day and go to the gym twice. It was slightly irregular then, but it progressively got worse. During Year 12, I would struggle to focus on my studies because I was so tired all the time, I never slept because I was so stressed and it just made me more likely to binge the next day. That's when I started throwing up. I would get in the shower after eating an insane amount of food (so much that it hurt), and then throw up until I couldn't anymore. That happened almost every night in the lead up to my HSC. When I finished school, it got even worse. I had my license so I would just go out to the local shops and buy every bit of junk food I could find. Then I would sit and eat it in my car by myself. Then I would come home some hours later, having lied to my parents about where I've been, and then hop in the...</td>\n",

Nothing like I imagined!I ended up falling into a bit of a hole towards the end of year 12, but passing which made my parents happy for a while, but got offered full time work at the racing stables that I worked in, I worked every single day for two months straight to avoid being at home because my mother seemed to never be happy with me, so I worked hard to save and planned to move out as soon as I could, but I ended up getting told to have my bags packed by the end of the week, so I left over night and stayed with a friend that lived very close by to my workplace who let me stay for the month until I was 18 and could get my drivers licence, but stress got the better of me about a week later because my parents were so angry at me for leaving and I was working very long hard hours my body could not keep up any more, I ended up spending a few days in hospital and left town to escape everything for a week with the support of my grandparents. After a further month I turned 18 and got my licence, I moved across the border to my boyfriends house, I left the job in the racing stables and started work for a forestry company, within the month my hard work paid off and now I have a supervisor position which I will stick with for another couple of years as I enjoy it!I still am sticking with my plans to join the police force but everything is cruisy now and it's the happiest I have been in a very long time!Have cannot thank my partner and friends for the support they gave me!I now after a few months have a steady relationship with my family again, they have calmed down and have learned how to support my decisions instead of trying to control me to do things they want, which I am thankful for that. Mum and I have formed a stronger bond than what we were when I lived with her, I am not sure if it is because we don't see as much of each other or because she realises I can thrive with out her!</td>\n",

It may seem like achieving it is impossible, but I can guarantee that it is not.  I would love to help, but it's pretty broad. If you don't mind sharing (I totally understand if you do mind, I'll try to help either way), what is making you sad?  This may be universal, so I will suggest it anyway, but it has helped me. (Recently, my mum has very emotional, and has had very extreme, irrational reactions to the slightest little things I do wrong. Two weeks ago, she reacted so angrily that I felt genuinely unsafe. The police came and I've been staying at my grandparents' since then, but my mum has still been sending me angry messages, and made it clear that she is still very scary.)  Do you have a hobby, something that you love to do and are passionate about?  For me, that was photography. I picked up my grandpa's vintage camera, and I put all of my hope into it getting fixed. It never did, but a friend of my grandpa's who owned a camera shop gave me a film camera, because he knew how important it was to me. Ever since I got that camera, it's almost like there is nothing wrong in the world. And when I am upset, I can go take some photos, and I will feel better. It's almost like I'm letting out all of my emotions into the photos I take. Do you have something you're very passionate about? Do it. Frequently. Let it be a distraction, let it be a source of hope and positivity, to break away from all of the darkness and negativity. Even if it's something you've kind of lost passion for, try it anyway. I actually was like that with photography. I lost interest in it for a couple of months, but when I found that camera (and I coincidentally also just so happened to be watching Life Is Strange videos, so maybe you can get a little inspiration, and let that help you gain interest in something), I just fell right back in love with it.

That's how I feel when I've finally acknowledged I've been suffering from anxiety and depression, which has been gradually crippling my life for 6 years. This whole time I've kept it to myself, convincing my social life I was completely normal and not crazy. Doing that for so long, I've just ended up convincing myself and continued to hold myself back. At home, I didn't come home to a warm supportive family which made it all the harder to become honest and open to those around me. You know, everyday I'd ask myself why I am like this, why am I struggling so much! Deep in my heart I knew what was wrong and for the sake of my future and ambitions, I KNEW I urgently needed help, but circumstances worsened at home, and with a mix of guilt and trauma I moved out. At that point I've lost control of managing my anxiety and, circumstances just added to my suffering. Then I had to start my first year at a new university, and make new friends who I couldn't tell my suffering too. I want people with anxiety and depression to know, that isolating yourself is the worst thing you can do to yourself. I'm 19 and I've felt so alone for the past 6 years that at this point, my whole existence has been consumed by this anxiety I've left untreated for so long. Anxiety makes someone consistently worry and feel urgent to do something, while depression drains your motivation and tells you it's impossible. Put two and two together and you have the worst combination ever. And for 6 years, it was this constant struggle. You can imagine how exhausted I feel, and how much love, compassion and care, I need now, more than any other time in my life. But for those of you, like me who don''t have someone to share their burden, start with Y.O.U. I realized I needed to focus on my SELF and practice self-love, self compassion and self care.

I have hardly any motivation to do anything. Unless you count me constantly wanting to curl up in bed, cry, and sleep all day...Since I've been feeling this way for a couple of months, I had decided that I'd talk to my parents about it over break, obviously after our Christmas festivities. However, this morning it was brought to my attention by my dad that my younger sister might be dealing with some depression as well. Of course, since my parents have yet to notice that I too am struggling, I just played the role of a concerned older sister. Truthfully though, I've been so stuck in my own struggle, that I barely noticed. I kind of feel horrible for admitting that, but I feel even worse because while my parents have already consulted with her doctor today regarding her mental state, I'm still struggling in silence and nobody is really noticing. Last year, I met with a psychologist twice for my anxiety and the experience was helpful but the sessions were not cheap and neither of my parents wanted to continue spending that much money on them. It's not that my parents are not trying to be supportive, I know they are doing their best. It just feels really unfair that I've been struggling and hanging on by a thread for a long time with hardly any help, and when my sister exhibits a few signs of depression, their reaction is almost immediate. I'm definitely not trying to downplay her feelings, I understand 100% that mental health is not something to take lightly especially because she's only 13. I just don't know how to go about getting the help I need. Plus, I feel like the holidays are just making everything a little worse because I'm tired of pretending to be happy and cheerful all the time. Right now, my moods are being blamed on pms, but I clearly know it's more than that. Any advice?</td>\n",

I think what has been said it is exactly what has been running through my mind, but I have had trouble coming to terms with it.  I think I need to first sit down and write a list of priorities and have a good think about what is going to best help me get through this period. From there I will talk to my partner and see how things pan out. I believe I need to start putting my wants and happiness as a priority now.  Thanks everyone for your feedback and wishes for my family and dad in particular.  Will keep you updated.</td>\n",

I’m leaving my job to find a new one, my parents, the house I’ve lived in all my life. To be working more hours and moving from everything I’m familiar with, which is really hard for someone with anxiety. And yesterday I found out that he’s cheating on me. But it was only texting, for 4 days, so, that’s okay? Right. Wrong. I was with him the entire time for those for days and I don’t know how you can look at someone you ‘love’ and tell them that, then look at your phone and send a text to a different girl. I really do love him and I want to believe that it won’t happen again but I just don’t know that I can. It just blows my mind. That anyone can do that. Especially when I was right in front of him, and I’m leaving everything for him. My depression has kicked in and I don’t know what to do I feel like this is all my fault. I’m not good enough, sex isn’t good enough, I don’t do a good enough job at that stuff, he’s bored with me. And if I forgive him how long will it be till he’s bored with me again. How can I go back to wanting to marry someone, always looking over my shoulder wondering if he’s talking to someone else. I don’t trust his words. I love him but I’m broken now.</td>\n",

I'm exercising every day, studying, working, doing personal projects but its still not enough. I know I just need to work even harder. I haven't experienced any grief, loss or abuse, I'm not lacking in friends or family, so the only logical conclusion is it's my fault and I need to fix it myself.

Your friends sounds like she wants to be there for you, but doesn't know how to handle the situation. Your friends finances behaviour sounds very controlling by banning her etc. To me that doesn't sound like an equal relationship what so ever. Is she OK?  It's hard having to be around people like that. I can also imagine there will be times where you will have to be around each other? When I am around very toxic people, I always have a plan and this changes from person to person (yes, I have had many toxic people in my life). Like for example, my  Mum and I never had a great relationship, so when I was around her and she would start with the put downs or blaming me for her own life decisions, I would communicate what she was saying was inappropriate in a much calmer way than what she was speaking. It takes a lot of courage, but my goodness can it be so much more empowering!  Know your limits, set boundaries, communicate them. If you are around him and starts being mean, leave. Try and find a way to communicate these boundaries with your friend so she is aware.  Just remember, his thoughts or behaviours lay with him and it doesn't necessarily mean they are true!! Try and stay strong, you seem to have a lot going on and keep reflecting and wanting to look after you, because at the end of the day YOU are the most important person!  I will leave you with a cheesy quote \"Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don't matter, or like you don't have a place in our story - because you do, and you have every right to be who you want to be.\" - Michelle Obama</td>\n",

I was never good at those, I didn't want to see himgo.There wasn't a lot of people that was good to me. I know I only knew you when I was a kid. But I'd like to say thank you to both you and popand alsoI'm sorry.Life just got so busy. I never had time to go up your way and sayhi. You were one of those grumpy Grans. You seemed stern and strict, but I kindaloved that about you. You had this thing about you that mademe feel ...comfortable. I'm so sorry I didn't get to see you more. Time just went by so quickly. Our family has always been a little screwed upwe're kind of a distanced family. I never knew most of my grandparents or cousinsI don't even remember anyone much on my dadsside after mom got a divorce. But I remember distinctly going up to youand pops place when I was a kid. You fed us, loved me.My memories a little fuzzy but I knew it was a warm and loving environment with you guys. I guess it was one of my fondest memories of feeling safe and cared about.I will be praying for you tonighteven though I'm not particularly religious. I hope you find pop over on the other side. I'm glad you passed in your sleep so it wasn't painful. I will always miss you. Some part of me will always think that you're stillthere waiting for me to come home. I want you to know, if somehow this gets to you..that I loved you and pop soo much. For being patient, and kind and scolding mewhen I misbehaved. I'm most gracious of all that you're not goingto be sick anymore or sad. I'm glad that you don't have to be without popanymore. You were so grumpy, and cheeky and silly. I bet I will still see you at the corner of myeyes sometimes giving me that disapproving look over your glasses. I love you so much. Have a nice rest Granny and please send pop mylove.

I am a pretty weird/awkward (not socially-awkward though) teenager that is lost. Haha! I am a pretty good mixture of introvert and extrovert. (just a bit about myself) And I do feel like guys have it a bajillion times easier that us girls. Like seriously when they go through puberty they basically go through nothing compared to girls. I 100% dislike wearing dresses and skirts and all off that crap, I'd rather be wearing something that I am comfortable in, like leggings, shorts, tanks, but i do like to wear crop tees.  I am also not into extremely emotional girls as I don't do soapy, that is not my scene. I also try to avoid bras at all cost so I tend to stick with sports bras (without wire) they are much more comfortable and don't give aching back pain. I am also not a of fan of having boobs either and I don't have tiny/small boobs or big boobs just average but I feel like now I am limited in clothing as boobs just stand out. And that can make myself really self-conscious so I try to stick to loose fitting clothes so they are not so prominent.  I also go to an all girls school. But this is my second year (currently in year 10) at an all girls school and I actually really dislike it, whereas before I was at a boys and girls school. And I feel that at an all girls school I just don't really fit in, whereas at my old school I found it much easier to get along with everybody, we all got along. But I don't know if that is because I have moved states and the people are just different or if the nature of a public (state) school is different to a private school (currently at) Maybe you are a tomboy!

Mannerisms and social conventions are all built on everyone putting on a facade, we lie just so the other person won't have to feel uncomfortable, suddenly talking about our problems is a waste of somebody's time.\"Teenagers are all angsty,\" they say, \"mood swings,\" they say, \"just trying to get attention,\" they say. Well, I don't even know what to say, i have a friend who is depressed and I don't know what to say to make it all go away.

This has hit me and my family hard. We had absolutely no idea he was struggling so much. Whenever we had seen him he was always so happy and kind. Any advice for how to cope and provide support to his family?Thanks</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey...I'm really upset at the moment, like  really upset like crying all the time and everything.I'm going through a tough time right now because my friend, let's call her \"S\" and I are in a really massive fight and Mum wants me to stop being friends with her because she treats me badly, and she's right. I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around me not being friends with her anymore, but she has been treating me badly. The other day I ran out of the  classroom crying in both Religion and Maths because of this situation, I saw a school counsellor and he wants to do an \"intervention\" I guess you could say. He wants us to be friends again. But my Mum disagrees.I don't know what to do?If I should go ahead with this \"intervention\" or  not?She also said to one of my other friends - lets call this friend M, I told M about the situation and I asked for advice and she gave me some guess. And then I went away but I could still hear them.I was in the library and they were outside.And then I hear \"S\" say to \"M\" \"Oh, don't be friends with her anymore, you should just be friends with me.\"I heard it and I started crying for the 4th time in that day.What started this whole thing is that she called me childish and told me to grow up, and she's being a hypocrite because she acts childish and goofy sometimes too.I think my brain just doesn't want to accept the fact that she's bullying me and stringing me along.I hate it! I thought I could trust her.I told her all my secrets, I just hope she doesn't tell anyone my secrets or start any rumors.What do I do if she does?I mean, I was there comforting her when her ex dumped her. (Ironically, the ex is my twin brother.)I was there comforting her, wiping her tears, hugging her, etc.And what does she do to me??!!SHE BLOODY STABS ME IN THE BACK!!!I'm sorry about my massive rant, I'm just extremely sad and upset.I don't have anyone, cause \"M\" is rarely at school.And I can't make friends.Did I mention I have Autism...Yeah! I hate it!!I ...</td>\n",

Back in 2014 I spoke to a kids helpline counsellor Rory and she was my favourite! We spoke 3 times a week for a year. Then on the 24th of November 2015 she left, my whole word came crashing down. She was my world and my rock I couldn't imagine fighting without her. But do you know what I have and I am. Every day I still think I wonder how she is, if only I could tell her how far I've come. Your never gonna stop missing her/him but all you have to do is just tell yourself you had this person for this long and its time for them to leave think of it as a dollar coaster if you stayed on the same rollercoaster itd get boring so you have to change. Same with counsellors she/ he wouldn't be special if you never left them. I'm always here if u need a hand head up and stay strong everything will be okay   \n",

Maybe something that could be tried first is making sens of the emotions that you feel. Is there any way you can seperate them? maybe youre feeling confused, sad, angry... etc. I know this is a bit silly to say, but I am sure your mom is trying her best to understand you. It is hard for someone to know exactly what you are thikning, so maybe with some help, you can explain to her exactly what you are feeling and how she might be able to help you. I know for me, I thought my mum just didnt understand me. She didnt know what i was talking about, and she certainly didnt understand what i was going through. With some help from a counsellor, I was able to sort of understand things through what she might be seeing about me, without me telling her what i felt. WE then worked together so that i could approach her and tell her what she was doing that was making me feel uncomfortable and then we spoke about what i wanted her to be doing for me, as in her responses and the way she spoke to me. OUr relationship now is so much better. YOu sound like you are really stuck at the moment. Have you thought about seeing someone? Maybe KHL, eheadspace for starters?I can recommend both, especially if youre not sure where to start.     \n",

I truly appreciate it and I think I'm going to seek some professional help no matter what people say about me.And I'm not Australian. In fact I'm halfway across the world. I live in Tunisia ( Don't know if you heard of it before ) but thank you for your support. I really appreciate it .   \n",

Any relationship(s), consists of at least two, no less... Any form of communication would be nice for people who give a damn once in a while. Talking is better for someone else who listens, rather than yourself that doesn't. Friendship is more vauable than love itself, for those who require one for maintaining sanity. Life is too short for opportunities to make a difference. NOTE TO SELF: Forget about talking, it's overated. #Truth Peace... - C.    \n",

He has anxiety/depression just like me. He hasn't seen any psychiatrists/doctors long enough to get any help. He is always stressed and unhappy. He is judgemental, irresponsible, and has deeply seeded issues with attatchment. I have leant him substantial amounts of money and not received it back. I'm a student - I'm trying to deal with my own mental health issues + his at the same time while trying to build a life for myself. I've often written posts on here about him before. It seems like he is an awful person from what I've just said, but he is very smart, caring, funny and loving. However his behaviour is now affecting me and everyone around him. He refuses to accept that he is causing any problems. I've spent my inheritance money trying to help him, but theres been no change and no support from his family. He goes to uni now which is great, but he is still so irresponsible - and it is almost like he is my son - which is disturbing. I try to avoid having sex, I hate it to be perfectly honest. If I move back home with my parents he won't be able to pay rent. His parents wont take him back. I can't leave him because he doesn't have the capacity to care for himself. I feel like I need to be selfish and move back home, but at the same time I need to look after him otherwise theres a good chance he might try to hurt himself. I'm tired of having to pay for him and be responsible for his things. Any advice?   \n",

I guess some people are just born this way even if there given a good upbringing a good job and wonderful girlfriend and family like I do, but i feel the way I do regardless   \n",

I think once you say hey I am also struggling with this, she will then figure out where to take it. Some things she might want to expand on straight away, others she may leave about to talk about later as there is only so much she can cover in one session but at least she knows.  I think if you just say what else is going on your psych will then determine what she wants to talk about or ask about what is the most pressing issue for you right now.  I struggled so much, in the beginning, of my sessions to verbalise what I was going through/feeling as it is not a normal thing we do in day to day life.     \n",

When I told them about the assault, I felt like it wasn't taken seriously. So I haven't gone to a session since late last year. At this point I don't think I'm ready to find a new counselor.    \n",
       "53   @CrunchynessHai o: know that you can always talk to me if you need to, I'm always looking for people to help : P I was going through websites trying to find one where I could help people and I'm glad I found what I was looking for : ) I can't say I've experienced what you have Crunchy but I can sure as hell tell what it would feel like :/Know that I'm always here for you if you need someone 'real' to talk to. (As if real should be something to be desired in the first place, everyone should have someone real in their life, someone they can say anything and everything to) \"Maybe it's just my selfish side speaking, maybe I just want to share these thoughts with people. These depressing, disgusting, self-indulgent thoughts. Even I feel sick to my own stomach when I think about how I want to know all this. I really should just let this desire to know their feelings go.\" Shut the ---------------, for one you're not selfish, far from it. If these feelings are real you would do yourself a favour by not denying them you know >;O I know how what you're going through would help feelings of loneliness to start to exist and believe me when I tell you it's only gonna get worse. \"But worst of all, will I ever find this \"real\" feeling that I desire? Or is it just an ideal that I will never reach?\" Haha : ) I remember thinking this, there's like a layer of feelings over you, wrapping you up like a sausage roll. Remember that feelings create feelings, if you're not feeling very happy chances are your thoughts will become unhappy as well and I talk from experience when I tell you that one year you'll think you'll never EVER get something you want and two or three years later you can find just that xD Crunchy, you're fineAnd you're going to be fine. And if you're still in high school/secondary school then it's perfectly normal to feel entirely hopeless. But know that it won't always be this way. Don't go thinking that you'll be hopeless forever cause I promise you in a few years ti...   \n",

Nothing had happened to him at all, not even a questioning, a meeting, nobody talked to him about my case, he was protected, loved. To him, he destroyed some meaningless undergraduate student's life, he probably already forgot about it had ever happened, but i am still crying now, crying everyday, out of school, out of hope and future, I had been thinking of killing myself many many times. I am just a trash and got played by him for 2 years, psychologically played, after he was done, he realised i was leaving, he just got rid off me by lying to the university, and he moved on like nothing had ever happened, getting promotion, more money, more female students coming to him, new young students every semester, he teaches 1st year undergraduate students, which was when I was 1st year undergraduate. After I was excluded forever from school, my life was destroyed, the university told me to \"have a good life\".   \n",

They lied so much and so badly, openly humiliated me and physically abused yelled at me, lied, made disgusting insulting statement and called it was an \"investigation summary\". They give all the credits and power to their own statement in their own official paper, they make up new rules along they way during the case to make sure I was wrong and the professor was right. It was so disgusting what they were doing.    \n",

I had an attack in class today because I got so overwhelmed with the amount of work that I had to do. I feel like I can't talk to my friends about it because they act like they aren't really interested in hearing what I want to say. I live on campus far away from my family so I haven't seen them in a while. I have tried to talk to the counsellor about everything but I don't seem to find that it helps. I just don't know really what I should do.Thanks   \n",
       "69   Hi, So I have been struggling with what I think is Bulimia for about 2.5 years now. Basically, it all started when my friend called me fat one day and I looked in the mirror and thought ''she's right\". I was 75kg at the time, which was slightly above the recommended for my height (I'm 5'8'') I decided to change my life, I went on a diet and joined a gym, I seriously cared about the processed foods I was putting in my body before and how much they had damaged me. Anyways, I ended up dropping down to 55kg at my lowest, I was feeling myself! Like I thought I looked so hot, I still got fussy about things not looking nice on me sometimes but overall I was happy with myself and my life. Then my parents started to get worried because the weight was just not staying on at all, I kept losing kgs without trying. My period stopped, and my Mum says white hair stared growing on my arms but I honestly didn't even notice. Then I started my senior years of schooling. With the HSC on the horizon, in Year 11 I put so much pressure on myself to study and do well, that in my spare time I would binge eat. When I started feeling sad about that, I wouldn't eat for the entire day the next day and go to the gym twice. It was slightly irregular then, but it progressively got worse. During Year 12, I would struggle to focus on my studies because I was so tired all the time, I never slept because I was so stressed and it just made me more likely to binge the next day. That's when I started throwing up. I would get in the shower after eating an insane amount of food (so much that it hurt), and then throw up until I couldn't anymore. That happened almost every night in the lead up to my HSC. When I finished school, it got even worse. I had my license so I would just go out to the local shops and buy every bit of junk food I could find. Then I would sit and eat it in my car by myself. Then I would come home some hours later, having lied to my parents about where I've been, and then hop in the...   \n",

I seriously almost opened up to my art teacher but then I realized and played it off like I was kidding or something. Today my father is like girls don't think you can get anything past your mother and I say ok. They have no fucking idea what I'm going through and they never will I'm 13 I only have to pretend like I'm fine for a couple more years. As soon as I'm 18 I'm outta there. Sorry for the rant. What should I do. And talking to my parents is not a opinion.   \n",

       "78   Hey Guys! Just thought I'd let you know that things have worked out incredibly for me! Nothing like I imagined!I ended up falling into a bit of a hole towards the end of year 12, but passing which made my parents happy for a while, but got offered full time work at the racing stables that I worked in, I worked every single day for two months straight to avoid being at home because my mother seemed to never be happy with me, so I worked hard to save and planned to move out as soon as I could, but I ended up getting told to have my bags packed by the end of the week, so I left over night and stayed with a friend that lived very close by to my workplace who let me stay for the month until I was 18 and could get my drivers licence, but stress got the better of me about a week later because my parents were so angry at me for leaving and I was working very long hard hours my body could not keep up any more, I ended up spending a few days in hospital and left town to escape everything for a week with the support of my grandparents. After a further month I turned 18 and got my licence, I moved across the border to my boyfriends house, I left the job in the racing stables and started work for a forestry company, within the month my hard work paid off and now I have a supervisor position which I will stick with for another couple of years as I enjoy it!I still am sticking with my plans to join the police force but everything is cruisy now and it's the happiest I have been in a very long time!Have cannot thank my partner and friends for the support they gave me!I now after a few months have a steady relationship with my family again, they have calmed down and have learned how to support my decisions instead of trying to control me to do things they want, which I am thankful for that. Mum and I have formed a stronger bond than what we were when I lived with her, I am not sure if it is because we don't see as much of each other or because she realises I can thrive with out her!   \n",

So I don't really end up spending that much time with him anymore. He really only ends up saying hi and we legit have no time to have a genuine conversation bc one of us is always being whisked away by friends or something. The thing is...I've held his hand like 3 or 4 times but the last time (and I think the time before) I accidentally pulled my hand away. It was just reflexes and I actually liked having his hand there. I'm kinda worried that he might think I'm tryna push him away but that's not the truth because tbh I really freakin like him. He's one of the cutest guys I know and a) my mum kinda knows him and b) all my church friends are cool with him.From your hormone crazed, stuck in love friend@AlexandriaD AAARRRRGGGGHHHH   \n",

Then today his sister (the compulsive liar) comes yelling through the house \"mum doesnt want either of you here and wants you to beeping leave\" (not the first time she's apparently said it)..so im confused if its a lie, and if it isnt, I'm not sure how to approach the situation because he won't say anything about it to his mum. And im left awkwardly sitting there in his room while he's at work some days.Extra info:Im working on my depression/anxiety so my place isnt an option and this is seeming less and less like an option and we dont make enough to move out yet.

       "102  No, it's definitely not too much to ask. Happiness is pretty much a specific human need. You deserve happiness, just as much as everyone. It may seem like achieving it is impossible, but I can guarantee that it is not.  I would love to help, but it's pretty broad. If you don't mind sharing (I totally understand if you do mind, I'll try to help either way), what is making you sad?  This may be universal, so I will suggest it anyway, but it has helped me. (Recently, my mum has very emotional, and has had very extreme, irrational reactions to the slightest little things I do wrong. Two weeks ago, she reacted so angrily that I felt genuinely unsafe. The police came and I've been staying at my grandparents' since then, but my mum has still been sending me angry messages, and made it clear that she is still very scary.)  Do you have a hobby, something that you love to do and are passionate about?  For me, that was photography. I picked up my grandpa's vintage camera, and I put all of my hope into it getting fixed. It never did, but a friend of my grandpa's who owned a camera shop gave me a film camera, because he knew how important it was to me. Ever since I got that camera, it's almost like there is nothing wrong in the world. And when I am upset, I can go take some photos, and I will feel better. It's almost like I'm letting out all of my emotions into the photos I take. Do you have something you're very passionate about? Do it. Frequently. Let it be a distraction, let it be a source of hope and positivity, to break away from all of the darkness and negativity. Even if it's something you've kind of lost passion for, try it anyway. I actually was like that with photography. I lost interest in it for a couple of months, but when I found that camera (and I coincidentally also just so happened to be watching Life Is Strange videos, so maybe you can get a little inspiration, and let that help you gain interest in something), I just fell right back in love with it.

       "103  You know that feeling when you feel so stupid you didn't realize something sooner. That's how I feel when I've finally acknowledged I've been suffering from anxiety and depression, which has been gradually crippling my life for 6 years. This whole time I've kept it to myself, convincing my social life I was completely normal and not crazy. Doing that for so long, I've just ended up convincing myself and continued to hold myself back. At home, I didn't come home to a warm supportive family which made it all the harder to become honest and open to those around me. You know, everyday I'd ask myself why I am like this, why am I struggling so much! Deep in my heart I knew what was wrong and for the sake of my future and ambitions, I KNEW I urgently needed help, but circumstances worsened at home, and with a mix of guilt and trauma I moved out. At that point I've lost control of managing my anxiety and, circumstances just added to my suffering. Then I had to start my first year at a new university, and make new friends who I couldn't tell my suffering too. I want people with anxiety and depression to know, that isolating yourself is the worst thing you can do to yourself. I'm 19 and I've felt so alone for the past 6 years that at this point, my whole existence has been consumed by this anxiety I've left untreated for so long. Anxiety makes someone consistently worry and feel urgent to do something, while depression drains your motivation and tells you it's impossible. Put two and two together and you have the worst combination ever. And for 6 years, it was this constant struggle. You can imagine how exhausted I feel, and how much love, compassion and care, I need now, more than any other time in my life. But for those of you, like me who don''t have someone to share their burden, start with Y.O.U. I realized I needed to focus on my SELF and practice self-love, self compassion and self care. Focus on nourishing my soul and finding peace with myself. But honestly, it's ...   \n",

Yeah, you're completely right, that's how I feel everyone is really becoming self-centred and it just gets really hard sometimes to try and cope with everything alone.  I have a job outside of school and i think that as a seperate social circle from school has been helping too.  Thank you for your message!  Any study methods or mindfulness tricks would actually be really great if you could share those, thank you!    \n",

After my mum used my grandma life savings on drugs without her permission my grandma sold our house and moved over 6 hours away from here and left all of us kids with my mum and her boyfriend. My mums boyfriend used to hurt my sister and she ended up having a big fight with my parents and she moved out leaving me too look after my other 5 siblings. Once she moved out and he couldn't hurt her he started abusing me. Until I took it too the Police and tried to get him charged and had a vro placed on him. My mum was told by police that she either had to kick her boyfriend out or I couldn't live with her anymore. She chose to have her boyfriend live with her and for me too be placed with another family.    \n",

I was never good at managing my time outside of school and I recently submitted a folio for visual communication design I am really not proud of. We have to write about it and review our work as another component of the assessment and just writing that makes me want to cry as I remember all the other components I forgot to include in it. The folio is 40% of the subjects grade aswell so I feel like I have stuffed up an exam and its allmy fault.. I'm also failing english too that I'm worried I won't even get a 25 thats needed for most uni's and its so hard to do well when you don't even know what to aim for for a result knowing nothing about what I want to study or do for a career. So yeah, I was wondering if anyone else is struggling with the same issues and or if their are other ways to get into things even if I don't get a 25 in english. I just want to be happy in the future.   \n",

Emotional, physical, verbal. I personally experience a lot of verbal conflict, but it has been about 3 years, give or take, since I was actually part of a physical confrontation, whereas other people may be able to tell you about how much physical or emotional conflicts they've experienced.   \n",

       "177                                     So I'm 16 and I've struggled with severe anxiety for a few years now and lately it's been really tough because I just don't feel like myself anymore. I have hardly any motivation to do anything. Unless you count me constantly wanting to curl up in bed, cry, and sleep all day...Since I've been feeling this way for a couple of months, I had decided that I'd talk to my parents about it over break, obviously after our Christmas festivities. However, this morning it was brought to my attention by my dad that my younger sister might be dealing with some depression as well. Of course, since my parents have yet to notice that I too am struggling, I just played the role of a concerned older sister. Truthfully though, I've been so stuck in my own struggle, that I barely noticed. I kind of feel horrible for admitting that, but I feel even worse because while my parents have already consulted with her doctor today regarding her mental state, I'm still struggling in silence and nobody is really noticing. Last year, I met with a psychologist twice for my anxiety and the experience was helpful but the sessions were not cheap and neither of my parents wanted to continue spending that much money on them. It's not that my parents are not trying to be supportive, I know they are doing their best. It just feels really unfair that I've been struggling and hanging on by a thread for a long time with hardly any help, and when my sister exhibits a few signs of depression, their reaction is almost immediate. I'm definitely not trying to downplay her feelings, I understand 100% that mental health is not something to take lightly especially because she's only 13. I just don't know how to go about getting the help I need. Plus, I feel like the holidays are just making everything a little worse because I'm tired of pretending to be happy and cheerful all the time. Right now, my moods are being blamed on pms, but I clearly know it's more than that. Any advice?   \n",

I hope y'all are doing well!  Ive been struggling a lot, I tried something reckless last week but in the end my family were supportive and tried to help me work through it. It's still a really uncomfortable situation, and I still don't feel comfortable bringing it up or talking about it in front of them but it has helped a bit knowing they are there.  Christmas is a hard time for many reasons for me, so I always get extra depressed/stressed around this time so that's probably not helping either     \n",

I live in Australia. I've been to the police before about something else and there really isn't anything they can do. Discord is not the same protocol as Skype, so messages go through Discords servers before it goes to the user. So it would be impossible for me or police to get an IP address or even a general location. Plus it doesn't help that the Discord server basically consists of all programmers.  So yes it's global.   \n",

Ive decided that I'll just have to wait until I'm 18 to tell her and if she still tells me I'm not then there's nothing she can do about it.  My friends have been great with me  coming out, they were surprised at first and thought I was kidding (apparently I don't come across as gay 😟) but they have been accepting and supportive in the ways that they can. However, it is hard that even though they want to help, they can't because they have no way to understand what's going on with me as they have had no similar experiences. Im really thankful for all the support people have given me here and im really glad I joined RO, it's really helped me feel less alone 😊   \n",

Looking in to that site now and yeah now you mention it, I will try to report this to Discord staff. They've been a little unresponsive in the past though  Just wondering about the ripple effects of this though. If I report Elson, he can make another account, tell Drake and Sarah that someone snitched on him. Sarah only really trusts me with that stuff and will know I was the one to report it. Elson will know it was either her or me and there could be some bad consequences to this..  Also when it comes to filing a complaint on the site, they require some stuff which I can't really get easily.

And in my last relationship I was cheated on and got my heart shattered, I feel I’ll never find love 😕. I can’t talk to friends or family about this cause they won’t listen or they will ignore me    \n",

But I find it hard to get started once I get past the first few chapters i enjoy it but I always find the first few chapters quite boring so I just give up. I know i shouldn’t...  I just feel like my current coach doesn’t give everyone a fair go, like when we are training in the nets he will give some of the girls an hour each in the nets and others like only 10 minutes so we don’t all get the opportunity to improve as much as some. I have talked to some of the older team mates who have spoken to him and things got better when they were around but went back to how they used to be when they aren’t their. Icecream1   \n",

It felts really good to just be able to discuss this situation with people.  I think what has been said it is exactly what has been running through my mind, but I have had trouble coming to terms with it.  I think I need to first sit down and write a list of priorities and have a good think about what is going to best help me get through this period. From there I will talk to my partner and see how things pan out. I believe I need to start putting my wants and happiness as a priority now.  Thanks everyone for your feedback and wishes for my family and dad in particular.  Will keep you updated.    \n",

In two weekends time, I’m supposed to be moving in with my boyfriend, in time for our 1 year anniversary. I’m leaving my job to find a new one, my parents, the house I’ve lived in all my life. To be working more hours and moving from everything I’m familiar with, which is really hard for someone with anxiety. And yesterday I found out that he’s cheating on me. But it was only texting, for 4 days, so, that’s okay? Right. Wrong. I was with him the entire time for those for days and I don’t know how you can look at someone you ‘love’ and tell them that, then look at your phone and send a text to a different girl. I really do love him and I want to believe that it won’t happen again but I just don’t know that I can. It just blows my mind. That anyone can do that. Especially when I was right in front of him, and I’m leaving everything for him. My depression has kicked in and I don’t know what to do I feel like this is all my fault. I’m not good enough, sex isn’t good enough, I don’t do a good enough job at that stuff, he’s bored with me. And if I forgive him how long will it be till he’s bored with me again. How can I go back to wanting to marry someone, always looking over my shoulder wondering if he’s talking to someone else. I don’t trust his words. I love him but I’m broken now.    \n",

Usually, I get by reading other peoples post and being amazed at all of their stories or writing in my notebook I know there is obviously something wrong with me, I know and accept that I'm not good enough maybe never will be but It's my problem, I'm lacking so I need to fix it and I'm trying. I'm exercising every day, studying, working, doing personal projects but its still not enough. I know I just need to work even harder. I haven't experienced any grief, loss or abuse, I'm not lacking in friends or family, so the only logical conclusion is it's my fault and I need to fix it myself. This was my first time posting my thoughts publically, I let a friend know but since they freaked out, I just rubbed it off as a joke. I'll try not to bother people again including on here. Hope I get through it myself, see what happens. Thanks again for listening to my rant.     \n",

I have recently found out that my partner of nearly 7 years had cheated on me twice with my former best friend. I'm really having trouble coming to terms with the break down of trust and the heartbreak. I don't know if I can truly forgive them and move on. I'm finding it really hard to have faith in my decisions and have faith in my relationship. Overall, I just feel like a shell of the woman I was and I feel like I will look like a fool if I do forgive them. Any advice is welcomed xx   \n",

The things I’m worried about like my future I’m an apprentice builder and I’m worried that I’m not going to be able to go out and work for myself and I also want to be able to go overseas and work. I’m also worried about my best friend she has a boyfriend right they’ve been together for a while and a few weeks ago her boyfriend and I went for a drive and we were talking and he said that he’s going to end the relationship eventually and I know she will be so upset and I can’t stand seeing her upset because I’ve known her for years and she’s had a rough life but she’s finally happy but I’m worried that when he ends it she’s going to be so upset. I’m also worried that I’m not going to have another relationship because I’m shy and I’ll be honest not the best looking bloke out there and yeah I know a bloke my age shouldn’t be worried about finding a relationship and stuff but it’s something that’s always in the back of my mind   \n",

No more tears today so far, stomachs churning but the thoughts are less loud which is nice. I was able to go out for a walk by myself and (with carer) off on a domestic flight now.Brainstorming things to do to keep my mind busy on the flight    \n",

I haven't noticed any change, and have doubts when it comes to religion that i'd like to ignore.Don't really know where i'm going with this or what my point is but there won't always be a clear answer.Anyway, if you need or want someone to talk to.. i'm here.   \n",

There are a lot less opportunities for that to happen these days though. I'm not really connected to the community, no. I wouldn't even know where to begin to be honest. I feel I have a pretty good sense for like-minded people, and I always make a point of acting on it whenever I come across one. It's just so uncommon for me to find one, you know? 'No' really isn't a word in my vocabulary LOL. I recognise that I should be doing more--again though, opportunities to do so are so infrequent and I just don't know where to go to create them!   \n",

Plus, I am someone who puts way too much pressure on themselves to make things perfect etc. Yes, yes, I am a perfectionist.  What do others feel about journal writing? What are some of the pro's and con's?     \n",

I understand that people have their own problems they're working through so I will try my very best not to hold it against them. Maybe they're not so great in communication this way, but they're actually pretty kind to me at times. I don't think I should unload my emotional needs onto them. I will try to find better ways to express myself.   \n",

It's a shame the stigma that surrounds suicide and how sometimes people can be so uninformed.  Your friends sounds like she wants to be there for you, but doesn't know how to handle the situation. Your friends finances behaviour sounds very controlling by banning her etc. To me that doesn't sound like an equal relationship what so ever. Is she OK?  It's hard having to be around people like that. I can also imagine there will be times where you will have to be around each other? When I am around very toxic people, I always have a plan and this changes from person to person (yes, I have had many toxic people in my life). Like for example, my  Mum and I never had a great relationship, so when I was around her and she would start with the put downs or blaming me for her own life decisions, I would communicate what she was saying was inappropriate in a much calmer way than what she was speaking. It takes a lot of courage, but my goodness can it be so much more empowering!  Know your limits, set boundaries, communicate them. If you are around him and starts being mean, leave. Try and find a way to communicate these boundaries with your friend so she is aware.  Just remember, his thoughts or behaviours lay with him and it doesn't necessarily mean they are true!! Try and stay strong, you seem to have a lot going on and keep reflecting and wanting to look after you, because at the end of the day YOU are the most important person!  I will leave you with a cheesy quote \"Do not ever let anyone make you feel like you don't matter, or like you don't have a place in our story - because you do, and you have every right to be who you want to be.\" - Michelle Obama    \n",

Starting in middle of January i got an anxiety randomly out of nowhere. Everyone says it could be seasonal because this has never happened to me before. Every couple weeks my brain finds something to latch onto and obsess over 24/7. This started because i was searching the internet ( which i know i shouldn’t do) and i came across something that said sexual anxiety and i didn’t read too much into it because i didn’t want to put more things into my head. Than i was thinking “omg does that mean i would be attracted to my boyfriend anymore because Of my anxiety” and than another thought popped into my head “what if I’m gay” and ever since then my brain won’t stop thinking about me turning gay and imagines and it’s just horrible. I don’t want to be gay and i know that sounds mean but I’ve never ever been attracted to woman and I’ve never questioned this ever. I’m just scared and i don’t know what to do. I love my boyfriend and i don’t want this to ruin our relationship. I don’t feel like myself ):    \n",

I had a great time despite difficult family circumstances. And while I was there at the beginning I was so excited about my new life in Sydney telling everyone how much I as loving it and being excited just to get back to it.. But as I came closer and closer to leaving again I felt worse and worse like I didn't want to go back to Sydney. Until the day I had to leave I couldn't stop crying. I am hesterical and cried the whole plane flight back to Sydney and the car ride home and most of the night and woke up crying too. And I feel like I am back at square one again. I have experienced severe separation anxiety from my mum in the past and moving was a huge step for me.. And I was coping really well for the first two months but it feels so bad to just feel sad about being back in the city even though I am enjoying it to an extent. Idk it just makes me want to move home - even though I know in a heart beat I'd be bored living back at home in Victoria I don't know what I'm looking for from posting this.. I guess just to get it off my chest and see if anyone else has had this after they have visited their home again after moving away.   \n",

It is a really big thing to move away and I know it's the right thing. Yes hanging out with my friends made me feel less homesick.. and I think just feeling comfortable in my surroundings. I will make a real effort to see them this week and do things around my local area. It's really tough though when you know how right it is for you to be somewhere but you have to be away from your family. It sucks...   \n",

It’s seriously messing with my head and it’s making me feel like I have to be gay, like everything in my life is a lie. It was seriously triggered after my girlfriend dumped me because she wanted to try being with girls, and since then I’ve been wondering if girls are right for me. I have no attraction to guys at all, and the bought of kissing one or being sexual with one grosses me out. I have nothing against LGBTQ+ people, I just don’t want this life for me. It feels like it’s forcing me to be gay, and it’s starting to make women seem unattractive to me. I don’t know if it’s just really bad because of the emotional trauma of losing my girlfriend, but I can’t take it anymore. I know I’m not gay, even if the voice of HOCD is telling me I am, because if I was gay then I’d feel relief at embracing it, and if I was bi I’d feel the same way. But all I feel is grossed out. Please, I could seriously use your help on this   \n",

Also I haven't been exercising for the last month and I feel really guilty.      \n",

But most people like my friends aren't fussed about it and tell me it really isn't that bad. I just wish it wasn't on my face, a body part that people always look at first you know. Honestly I feel kinda jealous that your skin condition was on your legs not your face, I wouldn't worry so much, I hope that doesn't sound ignorant though I know that it will still impact you mentally and the uncomfortable feelings with flare ups that you can't always control!  I haven't seen my new dermatologist yet I really hope it goes well and Im not wasting my time and money! Did you do a patch test where they put the patches on your back? Did you find out if you were allergic to certain substances?  Thanks    \n",

Of course seeking help and treatment shouldn’t be viewed negatively, I suppose it’s just a scary thought speaking to a person face-to-face about things I’ve bottled for so long. I dont know what I’d say.Still, I’ll try.Thanks for the tips for self harm, I’m doing my best.   \n",

I liked what you said about ride the emotions out instead of wanting them to stop and it was a good analogy to look at these situations as a cup full of water.

A month ago, I lost a lot of things and people that matter to me and now I'm just kind of trying to scrape by. I have severe depression and anxiety. I am also, oddly, a extrovert at heart. I like poetry and Shakespeare. I love too many things to list but mostly when I'm in the passenger seat with people I adore. My favorite color is yellow. And my favorite way to relax use to be holding on to my best friend but now that hes gone - I just kind of look at my plants and try to stay in the moment to relax. I hope I wrote this right, and I hope I don't sound too lame. It's nice to be here,     \n",

Unfortunately, we do not currently have the sufficient funds to afford mental help, so I have reached a dilemma. But I have been looking to other forms to hopefully put my mind at ease. So, that is why I am here today.   \n",
       "295                                               Hi Old girl. You must have missed my Grandpop. That's probably why you crossed the over sideto see him.I didn't get to see pop pass over, I missed the funeral...I'm sorry. I was never good at those, I didn't want to see himgo.There wasn't a lot of people that was good to me. I know I only knew you when I was a kid. But I'd like to say thank you to both you and popand alsoI'm sorry.Life just got so busy. I never had time to go up your way and sayhi. You were one of those grumpy Grans. You seemed stern and strict, but I kindaloved that about you. You had this thing about you that mademe feel ...comfortable. I'm so sorry I didn't get to see you more. Time just went by so quickly. Our family has always been a little screwed upwe're kind of a distanced family. I never knew most of my grandparents or cousinsI don't even remember anyone much on my dadsside after mom got a divorce. But I remember distinctly going up to youand pops place when I was a kid. You fed us, loved me.My memories a little fuzzy but I knew it was a warm and loving environment with you guys. I guess it was one of my fondest memories of feeling safe and cared about.I will be praying for you tonighteven though I'm not particularly religious. I hope you find pop over on the other side. I'm glad you passed in your sleep so it wasn't painful. I will always miss you. Some part of me will always think that you're stillthere waiting for me to come home. I want you to know, if somehow this gets to you..that I loved you and pop soo much. For being patient, and kind and scolding mewhen I misbehaved. I'm most gracious of all that you're not goingto be sick anymore or sad. I'm glad that you don't have to be without popanymore. You were so grumpy, and cheeky and silly. I bet I will still see you at the corner of myeyes sometimes giving me that disapproving look over your glasses. I love you so much. Have a nice rest Granny and please send pop mylove.  Sincerely Rain.       \n",
       "297  Hey! I feel the same way in some circumstances. Like I am not a girly girl or your average 'stereotyped' girl. I am a pretty weird/awkward (not socially-awkward though) teenager that is lost. Haha! I am a pretty good mixture of introvert and extrovert. (just a bit about myself) And I do feel like guys have it a bajillion times easier that us girls. Like seriously when they go through puberty they basically go through nothing compared to girls. I 100% dislike wearing dresses and skirts and all off that crap, I'd rather be wearing something that I am comfortable in, like leggings, shorts, tanks, but i do like to wear crop tees.  I am also not into extremely emotional girls as I don't do soapy, that is not my scene. I also try to avoid bras at all cost so I tend to stick with sports bras (without wire) they are much more comfortable and don't give aching back pain. I am also not a of fan of having boobs either and I don't have tiny/small boobs or big boobs just average but I feel like now I am limited in clothing as boobs just stand out. And that can make myself really self-conscious so I try to stick to loose fitting clothes so they are not so prominent.  I also go to an all girls school. But this is my second year (currently in year 10) at an all girls school and I actually really dislike it, whereas before I was at a boys and girls school. And I feel that at an all girls school I just don't really fit in, whereas at my old school I found it much easier to get along with everybody, we all got along. But I don't know if that is because I have moved states and the people are just different or if the nature of a public (state) school is different to a private school (currently at) Maybe you are a tomboy!  I would classify myself as a tomboy. Except for the clothing!  1. a girl who enjoys rough, noisy activities traditionally associated with boys. 2. A tomboy is a girl who exhibits characters of behaviour considered typical of a boy including wearing masculine clothi...   \n",

Our cries for help is seen as a cry for attention, showing emotions are seen as weakness. Suddenly it's rude to say you're having a bad day if someone asks how you are, it's only correct and polite to say you're good. Mannerisms and social conventions are all built on everyone putting on a facade, we lie just so the other person won't have to feel uncomfortable, suddenly talking about our problems is a waste of somebody's time.\"Teenagers are all angsty,\" they say, \"mood swings,\" they say, \"just trying to get attention,\" they say. Well, I don't even know what to say, i have a friend who is depressed and I don't know what to say to make it all go away. I wish i could say it's just \"teen angst\" and that it will all go away, but the truth is mental illness stays with us and we are all made to keep it to ourselves like it contagious, like it's insignificant, like it's a burden.Why do we have to hide it? Why can't we just talk about it without mocking it or justifying it?- R   \n",

We are just waiting for tomorrow, we wait for something or someone to surprise us, to love us, hate us, show us, we wait for those moments in our life all the while we prepare for the inevitable.The one thing we know will always wait for us. What is it like? After our last breath, what happens, we have waited for this practically all our life, thought about it endlessly. Well sadly some people, like myself, are impatient. We just... don't want to wait anymore.    \n",

My parents basically only have cereals, milk for their coffees and there's really not much in the fridge,  cupboard or freezer. It's all set aside for meals so if we touch it for lunches we get in trouble. I have asked them to buy more food and my mum just thinks I'm attacking her. How am I attacking her when I state the facts that there isn't anything to put on sandwiches? We have no salad vegetables or really anything. It's so frustrating that the food we do have is set aside for meals that we can't have for lunch or anything.    \n",

When I was in high school I told some of my friends I was feeling suicidal and they thought it was manipulation. Needless to say, after that, I had to leave.Once I lost all my friends it just got worse. Earlier this year I was hospitalized for trying to end my life, if I told my high school friends this, they would think I'm just looking for attention.Part of the stigma is that many people believe that notion, \"anything less than actually killing yourself is looking for attention\".   \n",

My husband has been mentally abused and physically abusive to me. i realize he is a physopath. atm i am applying my permanent resident and it is under processing now. if i count the timeframe roughly i will get it within prob 6months. The problem is i cannot stay any longer in this toxic relationship but also i dont wanna lose my permanent resident visa as im almost getting it. I dont know what should i do?

I work at a job that is so toxic, and I hate it. I want to leave, but I don't know how because I have been there for a long time... Plus, I'm afraid that I'll be unhappy, no matter where I go. My grandma is very, very unwell. It's so difficult to see her like this. This isn't how I want to remember her. And it's difficult to see my mum so saddened and accepting on the idea that she's going to lose her mum soon. Oh, and my partner of 8 years isn't in the country for a week. I know a week isn't a long time, but it's difficult 'cause he's my best friend and I want to talk to him about what's going on, but I don't want to upset or worry him. He's such a good guy, and I know he'd want me to tell him, but he's earned his time away from me.Gah, I'm so lonely.   \n",

       "338       I am 16 and a girl who goes to high school.I figured out I was gay like 3 years ago. I had my ups and downs and still having them. I lost friends but earned better ones on the way. Im not fully-out, just a copule of friends know. I have my best friend who has been supporting me for 2 years. She helped me accept myself,come out to other people and feel a little less abnormal. And she is not afraid to speak up about issues unlike me. I love her so dearly that I think I may be developing a crush on her but that's for some other time   The thing is I've been thinking about coming out to my parents,should I or should I not. So to get a second oppinion I texted her about the issue knowing she would be helpful as always. When I explained it she seemed to be extremely against it since my family hasnt show any sign of supportiveness about lgbt community. Later she told me she had to sleep and told me to write out my thoughts and she will check them in the morning. Since it was very late I was sleepy and very emotional and my mind was not working well. I was like drunk texting her. So jumping into different topics I texted that I was so afraid of making her feel suffocated and smother her with all my wories. Even though I was not thinking at that moment it was an issue that bothered me. But all of this was like a 2 sentence of 100 one. Later i fall assleep.    When i woke up I checked my phone and she didnt text anything about my so planned coming out to my parents. Just some texts about me being a basis gay (it is a joke that we made that i dont get offended) so I just laughed and denied it. Then she said \"I'm gonna be serious\" and I thought another joke was coming but instead she said \"I really feel suffocated sometimes\". She told me that she loved me so much that my problems sometimes can get too much for her. She even argued with her homophobic relatives just because their way of thinking. Told me that knowing that secret of mine is very hard for her and not some...   \n",

Then recently, I got into a car accident, I was at fault, but I found out that my insurance doesn't cover for car damages, so I have to pay for the damages to the other 3 cars, the cost will be around $20,000. It causes me so much anxiety just thinking about it. I can't talk about how I'm feeling with my family because they are more angry with me causing the accident. Fortunately, I'll start full time work soon, but I'm also anxious that I do not have the necessary skills for work and it's a very competitive place so I'm worried about the consequences if I don't perform. Then above all that, I feel so trapped at home and it hurts when my sister bullies me and my family ignores me. I can normally handle it, but I'm lately, things just have been overwhelming. I feel like so much anxiety is bottling up and I feel numb and lightheaded. I tell myself it will be ok, but the waves of being scared and numb come again.   \n",

I used e-headspace the other night. The lady I chatted to was very nice but all she could do is forward information to me. I kind of felt like that’s how they handle everyone and not to bother looking for help there again. I need someone to talk to, not a bunch of unhelpful information that I have already read.

I feel like justtalking with people such as yourselves is a little comforting when I don'treally have many connections to the LGBT world in my life. It's just a badfeeling looking back on years passing by when you could have been enjoyingyourself, the way you look etc, but you never felt right.... in what shouldhave been the best years of your life haha! Have you ever felt like thatbefore?   \n",

They aren't all that stressed about school. My best friend worries about me though, and says I should talk to someone, meaning either my parents or a teacher at school. I have also tried to talk to my parents, but they say I'm over exaggerating or I;m being silly. Many people over the last couple of months have been saying that I need to talk to someone, but I'm a bit scared to let too much out. I don't know if that made any sense but that's kind of what's going on.   \n",

Advice request #1: My friend lives in a sharehouse where her housemate is moving out. She is not allowed to get another housemate due to a signed agreement and she cannot afford her bond, let alone other living expenses. She cannot move to another sharehouse or back home due to having a pet. What can I do to help her? Is there any financial support that I could look into for her? She struggles with depression and anxiety too. I would love some advice as well on how to support her. Advice request #2: I heard yesterday that my friend committed suicide. This has hit me and my family hard. We had absolutely no idea he was struggling so much. Whenever we had seen him he was always so happy and kind. Any advice for how to cope and provide support to his family?Thanks   \n",

       "384  Hey...I'm really upset at the moment, like  really upset like crying all the time and everything.I'm going through a tough time right now because my friend, let's call her \"S\" and I are in a really massive fight and Mum wants me to stop being friends with her because she treats me badly, and she's right. I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around me not being friends with her anymore, but she has been treating me badly. The other day I ran out of the  classroom crying in both Religion and Maths because of this situation, I saw a school counsellor and he wants to do an \"intervention\" I guess you could say. He wants us to be friends again. But my Mum disagrees.I don't know what to do?If I should go ahead with this \"intervention\" or  not?She also said to one of my other friends - lets call this friend M, I told M about the situation and I asked for advice and she gave me some guess. And then I went away but I could still hear them.I was in the library and they were outside.And then I hear \"S\" say to \"M\" \"Oh, don't be friends with her anymore, you should just be friends with me.\"I heard it and I started crying for the 4th time in that day.What started this whole thing is that she called me childish and told me to grow up, and she's being a hypocrite because she acts childish and goofy sometimes too.I think my brain just doesn't want to accept the fact that she's bullying me and stringing me along.I hate it! I thought I could trust her.I told her all my secrets, I just hope she doesn't tell anyone my secrets or start any rumors.What do I do if she does?I mean, I was there comforting her when her ex dumped her. (Ironically, the ex is my twin brother.)I was there comforting her, wiping her tears, hugging her, etc.And what does she do to me??!!SHE BLOODY STABS ME IN THE BACK!!!I'm sorry about my massive rant, I'm just extremely sad and upset.I don't have anyone, cause \"M\" is rarely at school.And I can't make friends.Did I mention I have Autism...Yeah! I hate it!!I ...   \n",
